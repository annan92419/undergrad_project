### ABSTRACT

<p> 
  Machine learning, which dates back to the 1950s, aims to make accurate predictions with unseen (similar) data based on patterns discovered in existing data. In the real estate market, machine learning algorithms have been deployed in either determining house price indexes or estimating house sale prices. The latter is being studied the most by considering factors such as location, population, proximity to a nearby station, zip code, and many more. However, research on hostel price prediction is rare, if not nonexistent. To help bridge the gap, we will explore the impact of hostel features using three machine learning algorithms: multiple linear regression, ridge regression, and neural network, in predicting hostel prices. Empirical results support the potential of machine learning algorithms on the hostel market, with all $R^2 $ greater than 0.75.
