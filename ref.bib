abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

The focus is on the tools that both practitioners and researchers use in real life. It is intended to be a comprehensive collection of the theory, methods, and applications of regression methods, but it has been deliberately written at an accessible level. The handbook provides a quick and convenient reference or "refresher" on ideas and methods that are useful for the effective analysis of data and its resulting interpretations. Students can use the book as an introduction to and/or summary of key concepts in regression and related course work (including linear, binary logistic, multinomial logistic, count, and nonlinear regression models). Theory underlying the methodology is presented when it advances conceptual understanding and is always supplemented by hands-on examples.

Since housing price is strongly correlated to other factors such as location, area, population, it requires other information apart from HPI to predict individual housing price. There has been a considerably large number of papers adopting traditional machine learning approaches to predict housing prices accurately, but they rarely concern about the performance of individual models and neglect the less popular yet complex models. As a result, to explore various impacts of features on prediction methods, this paper will apply both traditional and advanced machine learning approaches to investigate the difference among several advanced models. This paper will also comprehensively validate multiple techniques in model implementation on regression and provide an optimistic result for housing price prediction.},

The machine learning approach uses regression models to predict the price of a real estate. A basic model is a model which is trained with data from one region and one property type. Feature selection and imputation are performed on various data sets in order to create a correlated and complete set to use in training, validation and testing. Because there are neighborhoods which do not contain that many transactions per property type, two neighborhood clustering methods are introduced with the goal to merge neighborhoods with the same characteristics, in order to create models that are trained with more data. Ensemble learning is used to merge basic models that are trained on di erent regions in order to decrease the error. Where a region can be a cluster of neighborhoods, municipality or the Netherlands. The solution being a stacked regression model for each neighborhood or fallback on municipality, resulting in an accuracy of 85:90%.},

Design/methodology/approach: Based on extant literature and market observations, the authors provide key concepts and an overview of the residential rental market dynamics in Ghana. Reseachers appreciate that submarkets may exist in the Ghanaian rental market but have ignored the empirical testing for submarket existence due to data asymmetries. Based on real estate experts and stakeholder consultations, a priori delineation of submarkets are constructed based on spatial, structural and a nested approach. Submarket existence is tested using the Kruskal–Wallis H test and Hedonic modelling techniques. Findings: By using fieldwork data from Accra rental market, the analysis provides credence to the conceptualisation of submarkets and how to empirically test for same. It is argued that researchers should use alternative methods to compare results to make far-reaching conclusions. Research limitations/implications: Examining the hypothesis that differential rental values exists for submarkets has implications for policy decisions to target submarket constructs differently to improve market maturity. Practical implications: The research provides stakeholder investors in the rental space an understanding of market dynamics for profit maximisation, and end-users to maximise utility in deciding where to live – and as such households could benefit from making informed investment decisions on housing.

abstract = {The features of many peripheral sensory epithelia have been demonstrated to be labile to altered sensory inputs, however, the extent to which this is a global feature of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) has remained elusive. One way in which this can be studied is through investigations involving genetic mouse models for sensory hypofunction in the vestibular epithelia, since these peripheral structures are normally under constant sensory load throughout life. Here, it was investigated how altering vestibular sensory information to the inner ear epithelia (utricle, horizontal and superior cristae), using the otoferlin-null (Otof-/-) mouse may lead to presynaptic and/or postsynaptic changes in the expression of commonly expressed Ca2+ binding proteins oncomodulin (OCM, �- parvalbumin) or calretinin (CALB2). No alterations were observed in the presynaptic expression of OCM or CALB2, however, there was a marked heterogeneous decrease in postsynaptic CALB2 expression in the Otof-/- epithelia. These results suggest that some epithelial features (postsynaptic CALB2 expression) of the vestibular system are sensitive to the loss of OTOF and dynamic vestibular sensory inputs, while others (presynaptic OCM or CALB2 expression) are not. This may provide insight into how widespread the abilities of PNS sensory structures to adapt to changes in sensory information are, as well as how certain peripheral cellular features within the vestibular system are developed and maintained.},

Proposed work makes use of the attributes or features of the houses such as number of bedrooms available in the house, age of the house, travelling facility from the location, school facility available nearby the houses and Shopping malls available nearby the house location. House availability based on desired features of the house and house price prediction are modeled in the proposed work and the model is constructed for a small town in West Godavari district of Andhrapradesh. The work involves decision tree classification, decision tree regression and multiple linear regression and is implemented using Scikit-Learn Machine Learning Tool. Index Terms-Decision tree, house price prediction, decision tree regression, multiple linear regression.},

Present machine learning algorithm helps us in enhancing security alerts, ensuring public safety and improve medical enhancements. Machine learning system also provides better customer service and safer automobile systems. In the present paper we discuss about the prediction of future housing prices that is generated by machine learning algorithm. For the selection of prediction methods we compare and explore various prediction methods. We utilize lasso regression as our model because of its adaptable and probabilistic methodology on model selection. Our result exhibit that our approach of the issue need to be successful, and has the ability to process predictions that would be comparative with other house cost prediction models. More over on other hand housing value indices, the advancement of a housing cost prediction that tend to the advancement of real estate policies schemes. This study utilizes machine learning algorithms as a research method that develops housing price prediction models. We create a housing cost prediction model In view of machine learning algorithm models for example, XGBoost, lasso regression and neural system on look at their order precision execution. We in that point recommend a housing cost prediction model to support a house vender or a real estate agent for better information based on the valuation of house. Those examinations exhibit that lasso regression algorithm, in view of accuracy, reliably outperforms alternate models in the execution of housing cost prediction.},

abstract = {This study uses three machine learning algorithms including, support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF) and gradient boosting machine (GBM) in the appraisal of property prices. It applies these methods to examine a data sample of about 40,000 housing transactions in a period of over 18 years in Hong Kong, and then compares the results of these algorithms. In terms of predictive power, RF and GBM have achieved better performance when compared to SVM. The three performance metrics including mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) associated with these two algorithms also unambiguously outperform those of SVM. However, our study has found that SVM is still a useful algorithm in data fitting because it can produce reasonably accurate predictions within a tight time constraint. Our conclusion is that machine learning offers a promising, alternative technique in property valuation and appraisal research especially in relation to property price prediction.},

	abstract = {Analysis of big data by machine learning offers considerable advantages for assimilation and evaluation of large amounts of complex health-care data. However, to effectively use machine learning tools in health care, several limitations must be addressed and key issues considered, such as its clinical implementation and ethics in health-care delivery. Advantages of machine learning include flexibility and scalability compared with traditional biostatistical methods, which makes it deployable for many tasks, such as risk stratification, diagnosis and classification, and survival predictions. Another advantage of machine learning algorithms is the ability to analyse diverse data types (eg, demographic data, laboratory findings, imaging data, and doctors' free-text notes) and incorporate them into predictions for disease risk, diagnosis, prognosis, and appropriate treatments. Despite these advantages, the application of machine learning in health-care delivery also presents unique challenges that require data pre-processing, model training, and refinement of the system with respect to the actual clinical problem. Also crucial are ethical considerations, which include medico-legal implications, doctors' understanding of machine learning tools, and data privacy and security. In this Review, we discuss some of the benefits and challenges of big data and machine learning in health care.},

	abstract = {This paper employs the hedonic pricing model to analyse the impact of housing characteristics on residential property values in Kumasi, Ghana, over a six-year period, and analyse the impact of the findings on property rating in Ghana. It is established from the analysis that: the number of rooms, floors, and property age; location of the property; availability of garage, fence wall and swimming pool; and land registration; all influence residential property values in urban Ghana, with the residential class where the property is located having the greatest impact. Employing the Chow Test, the results show that the implicit prices of the housing characteristics are constant over time, so it is justified to pool the data together. Over the six-year period, there has been about 49% increment in property values in Kumasi. The paper provides useful insights regarding the determinants of residential property values in the housing market of urban Ghana – these are very relevant to market participants and professionals in the market. It has also questioned the use of the replacement cost method as the basis of property rating in Ghana since it ignores the value of land on which the property is situated.},

Despite the frequent occurrence and the relevance of the missing data problem, many machine learning algorithms handle missing data in a rather naive way. However, missing data treatment should be carefully treated, otherwise bias might be introduced into the knowledge induced. In this work, we analyze the use of the k-nearest neighbor as an imputation method. Imputation is a term that denotes a procedure that replaces the missing values in a data set with some plausible values. One advantage of this approach is that the missing data treatment is independent of the learning algorithm used. This allows the user to select the most suitable imputation method for each situation. Our analysis indicates that missing data imputation based on the k-nearest neighbor algorithm can outperform the internal methods used by C4.5 and CN2 to treat missing data, and can also outperform the mean or mode imputation method, which is a method broadly used to treat missing values. {\textcopyright} 2003 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {The hedonic-based regression approach has been utilised extensively to investigate the relationship between house prices and housing characteristics. However, this approach is subject to criticisms arising from potential problems relating to fundamental model assumptions and estimation such as the identification of supply and demand, market disequilibrium, the selection of independent variables, the choice of functional form of hedonic equation and market segmentation. This study introduces and utilises an alternative approach - the decision tree approach, which is an important statistical pattern recognition tool. Using the Singapore resale public housing market as a case study, the article demonstrates the usefulness of this technique in examining the relationship between house prices and housing characteristics, identifying the significant determinants of housing prices and predicting housing prices. The built tree shows that homebuyers are more concerned about the basic housing characteristics of two- and three-room flats or four-room flats such as floor area, model type and flat age. However, homebuyers of five-room flats pay more attention to floor level in addition to the basic housing characteristics. In addition, homebuyers of executive apartments are less concerned about basic quantitative characteristics and have higher housing consumption expectations and pay more attention to quality and service characteristics such as recreational facilities and the living environment.},

The goal of this study is to analyse the predictive performance of the random forest machine learning technique in comparison to commonly used hedonic models based on multiple regression for the prediction of apartment prices. A data set that includes 7407 records of apartment transactions referring to real estate sales from 2008-2013 in the city of Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia, was used in order to test and compare the predictive performances of both models. Apparent challenges faced during modelling included (1) the non-linear nature of the prediction assignment task; (2) input data being based on transactions occurring over a period of great price changes in Ljubljana whereby a 28% decline was noted in six consecutive testing years; and (3) the complex urban form of the case study area. Available explanatory variables, organised as a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) ready dataset, including the structural and age characteristics of the apartments as well as environmental and neighbourhood information were considered in the modelling procedure. All performance measures (R 2 values, sales ratios, mean average percentage error (MAPE), coefficient of dispersion (COD)) revealed significantly better results for predictions obtained by the random forest method, which confirms the prospective of this machine learning technique on apartment price prediction.},

The data set has nine features. In this study, an attempt has been made to construct a predictive model for evaluating the price based on the factors that affect the price. Modeling explorations apply some regression techniques such as multiple linear regression (Least Squares), Lasso and Ridge regression models, support vector regression, and boosting algorithms such as Extreme Gradient Boost Regression (XG Boost). Such models are used to build a predictive model, and to pick the best performing model by performing a comparative analysis on the predictive errors obtained between these models.

	abstract = {This paper reports the results of empirical investigations that examine behavioural aspects of residential property valuations. Following the house price collapse of the late 1980s in the UK, there was considerable criticism of the valuation methods used by residential valuers. In particular for the current research, the valuation methods employed by valuers had not taken account of buyer behaviour in the valuation process, which contributed to inaccurate valuations. This research investigates both the attitudes of the consumers of residential property and the actual valuation methods used by valuers to determine whether they account for buyer behaviour accurately. The study was undertaken on a cross-national comparative basis in the UK, Ireland and Australia and pursued on a qualitative basis. Overall, the research concludes that although valuers believe that buyer behaviour is an important part of the valuation process they simply do not consider buyer preferences. In effect, valuers have reduced the valuation task to a confirmation of bid price and, because of lender pressure which occurs worldwide, valuers overlook the economic sustainability of the property asset, which has severe implications for housing markets and national economies that interact with these markets. {\textcopyright} 2003, MCB UP Limited},

The pair of publications was well-timed: hedonic price modeling was in the process of moving from a cutting-edge empirical curiosity to a standard method of price index construction that has been used in literally thousands of studies since. 1 In those two publications and in Maclennan's other papers on the topic, several important themes recur: (1) The need to put hedonic models on a firm theoretical footing, including, but not limited to, consideration of the consequences of disequilibrium; (2) To consider whether common specifications are complete, or reasonably so; including, but not limited to, questions of omitted variables, functional form, and the proper definition of a market; and the implications for our work of inevitably imperfect specifications; (3) The design of the pricing model should fit the purpose at hand. In this paper we selectively review hedonic price literature (and, briefly, some other related models) with a focus on these questions. The intent is to present ideas that are theoretically sound, so theory will be discussed; but our orientation is more towards the applied economist estimating these models, rather than specialized theorists.},
